Sorting Algorithms Project 4

In this project we we're tasked with creating a program that takes an input file or an array size and allows the user to select which Sorting Algorithm
to use and the program will return the sorted array as well as the number of comparisons. 

To run my program in odin, make sure all files are in the same folder including the text document and run this line to compile the code:

javac *.java

---------------------------------------------

Then type one of these lines:

Option One:

java SortingDriver <inputfile.txt>

Where <inputfile.txt> is the file you would like to have to program read. The program will read the file and make the array list from the numbers in the file.

Option Two:

java SortingDriver <n>

Where <n> is the size of the array you wish to be randomly created. The program will take this number then randomly generate numbers until the array is size n.

---------------------------------------------

After you type either of those lines of code you will be prompted with the choice of 5 different sorting algorithms. Select one by following the prompts.
Once you select your Sorting Algorithm of choice the proram will output the sorted array list as well as the number of comparisons the sorting alrgorithm made.
